   text: |
      Remix IDE is an integrated development environment, it allows developing smart contracts for Ethereum like blockchain, deploying and administering them.
      It is well suited for beginners who want to learn Smart contract development as well as advanced users who are used to blockchain development.

      Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.
      Solidity was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
      Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.
      With Solidity you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets.
   code: |
        pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
        contract SimpleStorage {
           uint storedData;
           function set(uint x) public {
              storedData = x;
           }
           function get() public view returns (uint) {
              return storedData;
           }
        }
